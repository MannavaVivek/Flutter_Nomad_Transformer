# Nomad Transformer

Nomad Transformer is a travel story app built with Flutter. It gets its name from my nomadic lifestyle and the Transformer based LLM used behind the scenes for the AI narration. 

## About

The goal of this app is to share my travel stories from cities around the world, narrated by an AI assistant. It was built primarily as a learning project to get experience with Flutter mobile development.

The travel stories are hosted in a headless CMS and fetched by the app, with caching to improve performance. Users can bookmark favorite cities, and persist them across devices by logging in with their email account.

## Features

- Travel stories from around the world
- AI-generated Human-curated content 
- Favorites functionality to save cities
